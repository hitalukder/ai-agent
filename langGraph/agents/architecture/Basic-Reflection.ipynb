    "#### Evaluator-Optimizer Pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This pattern involves an agent that generates an initial output, which is then evaluated by another agent (or the same agent with a different prompt).\n",
    "- The evaluator provides feedback, and the original agent uses this feedback to refine its output.\n",
    "- This cycle can repeat multiple times to achieve a higher quality output.\n",
    "- It's often used for tasks like code generation, writing and refinement, complex problem-solving, and information retrieval.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Reflexion Pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reflexion is a specific type of Evaluator-Optimizer where the feedback is in the form of verbal self-reflection.\n",
    "- The agent critiques its own responses to generate a higher quality final response.\n",
    "- It includes tool execution in addition to reflection.\n",
    "- Reflexion agents also store the reflections in an episodic memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Verbal self-reflection is when a language model (or agent) thinks about its own performance and explains what went wrong or right â€” using natural language.***\n"
